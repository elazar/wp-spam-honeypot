Adds a hidden text field to the comment form to trap spam bots.

== Description ==

This plugin works by adding a textarea field to the comment form that's hidden using a CSS style. Since bots donâ€™t 
generally detect CSS like this, they proceed to fill out the field like any other field. This implies that they 
aren't a human (or they wouldn't "see" the field with CSS hiding it) using a browser, in which case the plugin 
marks the comment as spam. This seems to catch the vast majority of spam with very few false results and doesn't  
require contacting a third party service like most spam plugins.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `spam-honeypot.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Be sure that your theme implements `<?php do_action('comment_form'); ?>` in comments.php and comments-popup.php 
1. Optionally, go to the plugin's settings page and change the hidden textarea name and/or specify the submit 
   button name; hover your mouse cursor over each of these fields for more details
